This Paper explores how emergent technologies such as 6G and tactile Internet can potentially enhance cognitive, personal informatics (CPI) in participatory healthcare, promoting patient-centered healthcare models through high-speed, reliable communication networks. It highlights the transition to improved patient engagement and better health outcomes facilitated by these technologies, underscoring the importance of ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) and realizing the tactile Internet’s potential in healthcare. This innovation could dramatically transform telemedicine and mobile health (mHealth) by enabling remote healthcare delivery while providing a better understanding of the inner workings of the patient. While generating many advantages, these developments have disadvantages and risks. Therefore, this study addresses the critical security and privacy concerns related to the digital transformation of healthcare. Our work focuses on the challenges of managing and understanding cognitive data within the CPI and the potential threats from analyzing such data. It proposed a comprehensive analysis of potential vulnerabilities and cyber threats, emphasizing the need for robust security frameworks designed with resilience in mind to protect sensitive cognitive data. We present scenarios for reward and punishment systems and their impacts on users. In conclusion, we outline a vision for the future of secure, resilient, and patient-centric digital healthcare systems that leverage 6G and the tactile Internet to enhance the CPI. We offer policy recommendations and strategic directions for stakeholders to create a secure, empowering environment for patients to manage their cognitive health information.
