Healthcare digitization has significantly enhanced patient care and alleviated the workload of hospital staff. This trend towards automation has also optimized the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals, leading to the emergence of smart ICUs equipped with modern wireless communication networks like 5G. However, this increased digitization presents new attack vectors and opportunities, especially regarding cybersecurity attacks. These attacks could compromise the resilience of smart ICU networks. Given the critical role of ICUs in healthcare, it is imperative to analyze and categorize digital threats in terms of the risks they pose to patients. This paper explores cybersecurity threats for smart ICU networks and offers a risk assessment of the potential worst-case impacts these threats could have on the network.
