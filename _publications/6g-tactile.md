This paper discusses the transformative potential of 6G technology and the tactile Internet in reshaping participatory healthcare models while architecturing these digital healthcare systems with security and resiliency by design. As healthcare continues to advance towards more inclusive and patient-centered approaches, the role of emerging technologies like mobile health, 6G, and the  Internet will become increasingly significant in facilitating these interactions while ensuring the security and privacy of patient data. Furthermore, the organizations providing healthcare to patients must ensure compliance with different regulations, which are also focusing more and more on cybersecurity issues.
