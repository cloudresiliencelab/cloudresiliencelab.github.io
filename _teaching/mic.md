Prof. Dr.-Ing. Patrick-Benjamin Bök is responsible for teaching Mobile and Internet Computing in the Master courses .

## Learning outcomes / competences
Students have gained advanced knowledge of architectures and software engineering concepts for developing integrated mobile applications with distributed, internet‐based backend systems. Furthermore, after practical work they are able to plan and implement multi‐tiered information systems consisting of mobile app(s), serverbased back‐ends, modern communication protocols, and advanced persistency layers. They have been provided with a deep understanding of mobile and web‐based architectures, accompanying frameworks, and the appropriate development and testing techniques. Students have been exposed to the spectrum of development activities, its methods, methodologies and mechanisms. Students are able to apply appropriate design patterns in different contexts. They know the appropriate use of components as well as their limitations. Students are familiar with a range of modern frameworks as well as common tools and processes. They are able to develop or apply their own ideas in this field in different contexts.

## Contents
The course provides a general overview of the topic of software development for mobile ecosystems and looks in particular at the basics of developing mobile systems, the basics of programming mobile user interfaces, the basics of platform-specific concepts, backend-based applications / communication with services, platform-specific in-depth programming and cross-platform strategies and technologies. In addition to these basic concepts and principles, selected mobile and backend-as-a-service platforms will be presented. The following topics will be covered, among others: 
- Fundamentals of Mobile Software Development
- Platform-specific programming languages & paradigms.
- Mobile ecosystems, mobile hardware and specific operating systems
- Concepts of mobile application development and architecture
- Specific platform concepts at the level of application architecture and user interaction 
- Distributed communication via mobile network stacks and backend-as-a-service
- Integration of libraries for the use of internal and external hardware (GPS, compass, RFID, barcode scanners) and standard APIs
- Cross-platform development (hybrid approaches and frameworks)
- Use of deployment mechanisms and distribution channels for the distribution of mobile applications
- Marketing and monetization of mobile applications
- Challenges and best practices in the development and operation of mobile applications
- Platform-specific deepening and development of mobile apps

## Teaching methods
Lecture with integrated and accompanying exercise. The course takes place in seminar style as an interactive presentation by the lecturer, with blackboard writing, projection and exercises on the computer using programming tools/integrated development environments (IDE) (XCode, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio).
