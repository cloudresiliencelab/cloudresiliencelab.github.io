Prof. Dr.-Ing. Patrick-Benjamin BÃ¶k is responsible for teaching Mobile Software Development in the Bachelor courses .

## Learning outcomes / competences
The students:
- analyze and evaluate the differences and special features of software development for mobile systems
- know and differentiate between various activities, roles, challenges, risks and solution approaches in the creation, operation and maintenance of software systems in current mobile ecosystems
- distinguish and compare different mobile ecosystems and can develop simple mobile applications
- are able to develop applications using Kotlin or Swift

## Contents
The course provides a general overview of the topic of software development for mobile ecosystems and looks in particular at the basics of developing mobile systems, the basics of programming mobile user interfaces, the basics of platform-specific concepts, backend-based applications / communication with services, platform-specific in-depth programming and cross-platform strategies and technologies. In addition to these basic concepts and principles, selected mobile and backend-as-a-service platforms will be presented. The following topics will be covered, among others: 
- Fundamentals of Mobile Software Development
- Platform-specific programming languages & paradigms.
- Mobile ecosystems, mobile hardware and specific operating systems
- Concepts of mobile application development and architecture
- Specific platform concepts at the level of application architecture and user interaction 
- Distributed communication via mobile network stacks and backend-as-a-service
- Integration of libraries for the use of internal and external hardware (GPS, compass, RFID, barcode scanners) and standard APIs
- Cross-platform development (hybrid approaches and frameworks)
- Use of deployment mechanisms and distribution channels for the distribution of mobile applications
- Marketing and monetization of mobile applications
- Challenges and best practices in the development and operation of mobile applications
- Platform-specific deepening and development of mobile apps

## Teaching methods
Lecture with integrated and accompanying exercise. The course takes place in seminar style as an interactive presentation by the lecturer, with blackboard writing, projection and exercises on the computer using programming tools/integrated development environments (IDE) (XCode, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio).
