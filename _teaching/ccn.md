Prof. Dr.-Ing. Patrick-Benjamin BÃ¶k is responsible for teaching Computer- und Cloud-Networks in the Bachelor courses .

## Learning outcomes / competences
Students know the basic structures and interrelationships of modern computer networks, are able to design the content of configuration elements and can place the behavior of networks, algorithms and protocols in the context of application behavior at a higher level. In addition, students are able to independently analyze traffic in networks and simulate network structures and protocol behavior. In the context of cloud networks, students are able to develop architectures for different cloud network types and application environments.

## Contents
The following topics will be covered, among others: 
- Local wired networks
- Local and mobile wireless networks
- Modern Inter-networking
o Internet Protocol versions 4 and 6
o Internet routing structures, algorithms and protocols
o Internet peering structures and protocols
- Modern transport and application protocols (QUIC, RTP, HTTP/3)	
- Quality of service, performance engineering and congestion control
- Protocols and concepts of the Internet of Things
- Private, public and hybrid cloud networks
- Software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV)
- Monitoring and analysis of network traffic
- Simulation and analysis of networks and protocols

## Teaching methods
Lecture with integrated and accompanying exercises. The course takes place in seminar style, with whiteboard writing and projection as well as the use of software, e.g. for simulating or analyzing networks. The practical exercises take place in the Cloud Resilience Lab.
